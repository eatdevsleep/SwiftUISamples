# SwiftUI Samples

This is a collection of SwiftUI samples. Each project is designed to demonstrate a single best practise in an isolated manner, with a test app and unit tests. 
This will culminate in the ultimate goal of creating a _Starter Swift UI_ template which incorporates all of the concepts in a cohesive starter SwiftUI project.

## Features
1. Event Aggregator
    * Demonstrates the use of a simple _Event Aggregator_ that allows a pub/sub pattern to be used between Views or View Models. This enables components in a SwiftUI app to communicate in a decoupled manner.

## Usage

This can be built using Xcode 13+
